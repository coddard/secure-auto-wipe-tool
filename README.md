## üìñ Overview
Secure Auto-Wipe Tool is an NSA-grade automated data destruction system that combines military-grade cryptography with physical media sanitization. Designed for sensitive operations, this tool automatically and irreversibly destroys all data on USB drives after a preset time interval (6/12/24 hours) using a dual-layer security approach:

1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - All files are encrypted at rest
2. **DoD 5220.22-M Compliant Wiping** - 7-pass secure deletion protocol
3. **Tamper-Proof Countdown Timer** - HMAC-protected destruction schedule

## üõ† Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Linux/macOS/Windows (Tested on Ubuntu 22.04/Win11/macOS Ventura)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone [https://github.com/coddard/Secure-Auto-Wipe-Tool.git](https://github.com/coddard/secure-auto-wipe-tool.git)
cd Secure-Auto-Wipe-Tool

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install pycryptodomex

# 3. Verify installation
python Secure-Auto-Wipe-Tool.py --help


üöÄ Usage
Initialization (First Run)
bash

# Initialize with 24-hour destruction timer
python secure_wipe.py /path/to/usb -t 24 --init

    You'll be prompted for a secure passphrase

    All files will be encrypted in-place

    Destruction timer starts immediately

Normal Operation
bash

# Background execution (Linux/macOS)
nohup python secure_wipe.py /path/to/usb &

# Windows (Run in separate cmd window)
start /B python secure_wipe.py D:\USB

üîç How It Works
Phase 1: Initialization

    Key Derivation
    PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (210,000 iterations) creates encryption key

    File Encryption
    All files encrypted with AES-256-GCM (16-byte nonce, 16-byte tag)

    Timer Setup
    HMAC-Secured timestamp stored in hidden sector

Phase 2: Background Process
Diagram
Code
Phase 3: Secure Deletion

    Crypto-Shredding - Overwrite encrypted files 7x with random data

    Metadata Purge - Wipe directory entries and FAT tables

    Self-Destruction - Remove all tool traces from USB

‚ùì FAQ

Q: Does this work on SSDs?
A: While effective, physical media characteristics may affect completeness. Use with hardware-encrypted drives for maximum security.

Q: Can I change the timer?
A: Timer is immutable after initialization to prevent tampering.

Q: What if I lose the passphrase?
A: Data is irrecoverable - designed for secure destruction, not backup.

Q: Can I pause the timer?
A: Removal pauses timing - countdown resumes when reconnected.
‚ö† Warning

THIS TOOL PERMANENTLY DESTROYS DATA
Test with disposable media before live deployment. Developers assume no liability for data loss.
