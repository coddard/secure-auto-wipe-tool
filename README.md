## üìñ Overview
Secure Auto-Wipe Tool is an NSA-grade automated data destruction system that combines military-grade cryptography with physical media sanitization. Designed for sensitive operations, this tool automatically and irreversibly destroys all data on USB drives after a preset time interval (6/12/24 hours) using a dual-layer security approach:

1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - All files are encrypted at rest
2. **DoD 5220.22-M Compliant Wiping** - 7-pass secure deletion protocol
3. **Tamper-Proof Countdown Timer** - HMAC-protected destruction schedule
